# ColVO: Colonoscopic Visual Odometry Considering Geometric and Photometric Consistency

## Introduction

ColVO is an open-source project dedicated to  estimating colon
depth and colonoscopic pose. The primary algorithms utilized two key components: a deep couple strategy for depth and pose estimation (DCDP) and a light consistent calibration mechanism (LCC).

DCDP utilization of multimodal fusion and loss function constraints to couple depth and pose estimation modes ensures seamless alignment of geometric projections between consecutive frames. Meanwhile, LCC accounts for brightness variations by recalibrating the luminosity values of adjacent frames, enhancing ColVO’s robustness.

We also demonstrate two valuable applications: immediate polyp
localization and complete 3D reconstruction of the intestine.
